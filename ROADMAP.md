# Wikipedia Search Engine - Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines planned improvements for the Wikipedia search engine project, organized in a logical order from foundational to advanced features.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Improvements

### 1.1 Data Processing Enhancements
- [ ] Improve Wikipedia markup parsing (handle templates, infoboxes, redirects)
- [ ] Better text extraction (remove navigation elements, clean formatting)
- [ ] Handle different Wikipedia namespaces (articles, talk pages, categories)
- [ ] Extract and preserve article metadata (categories, links, timestamps)

### 1.2 Search Quality Basics
- [ ] Implement TF-IDF scoring for better relevance ranking
- [ ] Add phrase search support (exact matches with quotes)
- [ ] Basic fuzzy search for handling typos
- [ ] Case-insensitive search improvements

### 1.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize index data structures for faster lookups
- [ ] Implement index compression to reduce storage
- [ ] Add parallel processing for article parsing
- [ ] Improve memory usage during large file processing

## Phase 2: Enhanced Search Features

### 2.1 Advanced Search Capabilities
- [ ] Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- [ ] Advanced ranking algorithms (BM25, PageRank-style)
- [ ] Search within specific article sections
- [ ] Wildcard and partial matching

### 2.2 User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Better Streamlit UI with modern design
- [ ] Search result pagination
- [ ] Snippet highlighting for search terms
- [ ] Search history and saved searches
- [ ] Export results (CSV, JSON, PDF)

### 2.3 Search Intelligence
- [ ] Auto-complete and search suggestions
- [ ] "Did you mean?" spell correction
- [ ] Related articles suggestions
- [ ] Popular/trending searches display

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 3.1 Content Understanding
- [ ] Article categorization and tagging
- [ ] Language detection and multi-language support
- [ ] Content summarization for long articles
- [ ] Extract and index article links and references

### 3.2 Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Incremental index updates (add new articles without full rebuild)
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Distributed search across multiple indexes
- [ ] Real-time search suggestions

### 3.3 Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Search analytics dashboard
- [ ] Performance monitoring (search latency, index size)
- [ ] User behavior tracking (click-through rates, popular queries)
- [ ] A/B testing framework for search improvements

## Phase 4: Advanced Integration

### 4.1 API Development
- [ ] RESTful API for programmatic access
- [ ] GraphQL API for flexible queries
- [ ] Rate limiting and authentication
- [ ] API documentation and examples

### 4.2 Machine Learning Enhancement
- [ ] Learning to rank models
